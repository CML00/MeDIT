# MeDIT

Medical and Digital Image Toolbox (MeDIT) support a bunch of functions to process medical image and digital images. This was used for the engineers on image processing. 

If you publish any work which uses this package, I will appreciate that you could cite the following publication: [Song Y, Zhang YD, Yan X, Liu H, Zhou M, Hu B, Yang G, Computer-aided diagnosis of prostate cancer using a deep convolutional neural network from multiparametric MRI. J Magn Reson Imaging. 2018 Apr 16. doi: 10.1002/jmri.26047.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29659067)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisties
The below modules must be installed first to make the MeDIT work. 

```
- dicom
- dicom2nifti
- h5py
- matplotlib (seaborn)
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
```

### Installing
Just clone it by typing in:

```
git clone https://github.com/salan668/MeDIT.git
```
If you would like to use MeDIT in any project, please add the path in your system envirement. A trick method is to create a .pth file in the site-packages folder (<Your own python folder>\Lib\site-packages) and add a path that point to the root folder of the MeDIT.
